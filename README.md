## This was my first project so it may look ugly. It's only frontend because i can't upload server-side to github pages

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known issues/changes to make: 

* Implement redirect 301 system

* Use global variable to hide the key on head html

* Validate the form is completed before sending, do this via server-side with node so the user can't edit the front-end to bypass this

* Show the user 3rd party cookies banner and a link to its service's information (google recapcha)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secondary changes to make:

* Make about slide animation
* Nav buttons aren't working properly sometimes
* Change the name of the project to the actual one in package.json

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last changes i made:

* Saving current language on localstorage
